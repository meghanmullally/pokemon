# Pokémon App

After a break of 2.5 years, I decided to get back into coding with a project centered around Pokémon. This application is built using React.js, JavaScript, Redux, and Material UI. The goal of this project is to reacquaint myself with coding and pick up new skills, for example on Redux.

**Deployment**: [Pokémon App](https://poketrainercentral.netlify.app/)

## Features

- **Autocomplete Search:** Easily find Pokémon using the Material UI Autocomplete feature for a seamless searching experience.

- **Detailed Pokémon Profiles:** Dive into comprehensive profiles with detailed information, moves, and evolution chains.

## Technologies

```React.js```
```JavaScript```
```Redux```
```Material UI```

## Lessons Learned

- **Return to Front-End:** Embraced the changes and advancements in the world of front-end development.

- **PokeAPI Connection:** Chose the PokeAPI for my first project back, blending passion for exploration with coding skills.

- **Redux Exploration:** Delved into the world of Redux, gaining insights into its application for efficient state management.

## Potential Future Features
